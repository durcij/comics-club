This week, we did a fun new art activity where we picked subjects from the board to draw, and then passed those around the room from person to person.

## Important Notices

All votes will now be held in meetings, in a similar way to those run in LAG and ARGO meetings.

Reading and drawing days are back!  There's one every four weeks during our CCC times on Saturdays.

This week's (February 22st) read will be Garfield Minus Garfield.

T-shirts have been designed!  Please submit your information [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScV7z0UpsXuaAsZiq4vp2tpfcicbPbnC_3hbV_u2dTerl1bZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you'd like one.  They'll be free or a few bucks but no more than five.
