This week, everyone was busy, not feeling well, or some combination of the two.  We still got our votes in for the next two weeks.

## Officer Announcements

**Jordan:**  Happy Monday.  We're all doing... \*gestures wildly at room\*  Also, I was told to mention that I have a nose hickey.  So that's a thing.

**Linh:**  My one true ambition is to make quality hentai for free.

**Will:**  Just keep swimming.

**Gabby:**   Iâ€™m dying inside, but thatâ€™s okay. ðŸ˜‚

**Gwen:**  Fluff cat real cute. Soft as bunny.

**feck:**  Wondering what the future holds can be a feckin' nightmare.

## Important Notices

All votes will now be held in meetings, in a similar way to those run in LAG and ARGO meetings.

Reading and drawing days are returning!  There will be one every four weeks during our CCC times on Saturdays.

This week's (February 1sth) *discussion* will be the Witcher.

T-shirts have been designed!  Please submit your information [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScV7z0UpsXuaAsZiq4vp2tpfcicbPbnC_3hbV_u2dTerl1bZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you'd like one.  They'll be free or a few bucks but no more than five.
