This week, we did a new activity where we wrote a description for a character, and then passed them on to the next person to have them draw them.  Next week we'll be writing stories featuring them.

## Officer Announcements

**Jordan:**  I spent 12 hours yesterday figuratively and literally bashing my head against a wall feat Mike as Mike.

**Linh:**  Oh [duck]!  I forgot my USB.

**Will:**  Shoutout to the ghost of CC for free pizza with trackers.

**Gabby:**  GUESS WHO'S BACK!  BTS, BEACHES!
