## Important Notices

We're looking for suggestions in regards to live reads, and, potentially, all of CCC.  We've noticed low turnouts at the Quigley Auditorium events, so please fill out the Google Form we have [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Lik8WxJW1feJGKSF2) so that we can determine what days/locations would work better for all of our members.

Also, the first meeting after spring break will be officer nomination day!  This means that we'll be doing nominations on March 25th and voting for the new officers at the next meeting on April 1st.

The final deadline for Green Stripe submission will be on March 11th, 2019, right around the start of Spring Break.  Make sure to finish up any submissions before then so that we can include them in the Greenstripe!
