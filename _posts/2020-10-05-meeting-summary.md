## Important Notices

Comics Club Complete is every weekend, alternating between *discussing* things and other events like Live Read and reading and drawing days.

Our first reading and drawing day is coming on the 17th!  We'll release a spreadsheet of our library for requests soon!

Copyright Free Art-tober is here!  You can send your submissions however you like!  If you post it on Instagram, please use the hashtag "#acarttober2020" to let us know you're submitting it to us!

T-shirts have been designed!  We'll be getting them, and hopefully masks, to everyone as soon as possible (which is looking to be October at the soonest...)!

Send us comics for the Green Stripe!  They can be good, they can be bad, they can be silly, they can be sad.  Be it in crayon, marker, pencil, or pen, if it gets sent we'll put it in!  Send them my way at <[nguyenmail](mailto:nguyenmail@allegheny.edu)>.  More info on the Green Stripe will be coming soon, as well!
