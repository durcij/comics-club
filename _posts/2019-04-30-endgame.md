Tomorrow, May 1st will be the Avengers:  Endgame trip!

As a reminder, we'll be meeting at the Brooks Walk bus stop at around **5:50 PM**!  When you arrive, meet with Jordan to get checked in.  Once we get to the theater, tickets will be distributed.  The showing will begin at **7:00 PM**, so if you're unable to come by bus with everyone else, please try to find another means of transport, and notify an officer so that your ticket is not given away.  Be prepared to pay for your own snacks.
