The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei7sXJFbBpItXMxJ6UAPmIxvijNi7HmpYNLKE2q_pQaAwMog/viewanalytics) are in!  Castlevania has won the vote for our *discussion* this week!  We'll be starting our *discussion* from the beginning of the show, so no worries if you haven't seen it before.

Note that, if you want to look at the results, there are two Green Stripe boost votes in this, one for Castlevania (going from 3 to 4 votes), and one for Chargeman Ken! (going from 2 to 3 votes).

The *discussion* will be gathering around 2:00pm eastern in the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The show depicts Trevor Belmont, a man from a lineage of monster hunters, as he tries to do what his family has for years:  kill Dracula.  It's based on Castlevania III:  Dracula's Curse for the NES, but please believe me when I tell you that you don't need any knowledge of the games to enjoy the show.  That said, like the games, the show can be very violent at times, so if you plan on joining the *discussion*, please don't be afraid to step out if you become uncomfortable.
