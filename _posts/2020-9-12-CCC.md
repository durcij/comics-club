The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv2KF_KmCa6PDEJiDNKgMky1nY2usgkpn1VrJbxBQ1pshDQg/viewanalytics) are in!  Food Wars! has won the vote for our first *discussion* of the semester!  We'll be starting our *discussion* from the beginning of the show, so no worries if you haven't seen it before.

The *discussion* will be gathering around 3:00pm eastern in the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The show follows Soma Yukihira, the son of the owner of a small family restaurant, who is enrolled in on of the best culinary schools in Japan by his father.  This show is pretty graphic, as, while eating good food, many characters lose their clothes, and almost always have apparent foodgasms, if you feel uncomfortable with the *discussion* at any time, please don't be afraid to hop out.
