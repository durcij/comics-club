The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddsF9wR4Mm9X3CnyUFpf4v6vcNeLq6zXpSZwDPtBFyA2KhRA/viewanalytics) are in!  The Spectacular Spider-Man has won the vote for our second *discussion* of the semester!  We'll be starting our *discussion* from the beginning of the show, so no worries if you haven't seen it before.

The *discussion* will be gathering around 3:00pm eastern in CC 301/302 and the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The show centers on Peter Parker, a young man with a humble life and... well... you know... spider powers.  This show isn't particularly graphic or intense, but if you feel uncomfortable with the *discussion* at any time, please don't be afraid to hop out.
