## Meeting Summary

In this week's meeting, we created icons for ourselves, and little messages for a members-focused page in the Greenstripe.  If you weren't at the meeting, but would like to add your own icon/blurb, draw something up, be it digitally or traditionally, and add a little bio for yourself.  Then just send it in to Jordan at <[durcij](mailto:durcij@allegheny.edu)>!
