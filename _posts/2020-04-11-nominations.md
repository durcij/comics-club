Hello, everyone!  It's time for our fourth set of CCC nominations for our fourth off-campus CCC.  Click [here](https://forms.gle/YnETeHee2AVCGMHH8) to go to the nomination form.  Please do so before Monday the 13th at 5pm, when the vote form will go out!  Also, remember that, if you submit a Green Stripe submission through the voting form that'll come out on Monday, your first choice vote for next week will be counted as two votes thanks to the Green Stripe boost, so get cracking at something now!
