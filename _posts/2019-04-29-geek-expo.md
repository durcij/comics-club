The David Shipe Memorial Geek Life Expo was a huge success!  Allegheny's Geek Life organizations were able to raise a total of **$128.21**!

About half of the money will be going to the native pollinator at Dave's cemetery garden, and the rest will be going to the National Brain Tumor Society to help further fund research!

Thank you everyone who came, and especially to all of those who donated!
