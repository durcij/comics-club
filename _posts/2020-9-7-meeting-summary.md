This week, we went over the club's plans for the year, and nominated things to *discuss*.  

## Officer Announcements

**Jordan:**  Welcome to what's going to be an interesting year for Comics Club and year overall.

**Linh:**  The internet has been really off and on in my room the past few days.

**Will:**  Everyone, please: stay safe; stay healthy; and don't do anything stupid.  And can the school stop making us prisoners.

**Gabby:**  Welcome back to a new semester!  While we are facing new challenges, let's all take a minute to smile and be kind to one another.

**Gwen:**   I started playing Breath of the Wild, so we'll see if it interferes with comping.

**feck:**  *Not feckin' applicable*

## Important Notices

Comics Club Complete is every weekend, alternating between *discussing* things and other events like Live Read and reading and drawing days.

Elections will be happening soon once we figure out how that can happen.

T-shirts have been designed!  We'll be getting them, and hopefully masks, to everyone as soon as possible!

Send us comics for the Green Stripe!  They can be good, they can be bad, they can be silly, they can be sad.  Be it in crayon, marker, pencil, or pen, if it gets sent we'll put it in!  Send them my way at <[nguyenmail](mailto:nguyenmail@allegheny.edu)>.  More info on the Green Stripe will be coming soon, as well!
