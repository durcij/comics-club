As a reminder, on March 25th, the first meeting after spring break, we'll be
doing nominations!  Any members who would like to be officers are strongly
encouraged to attend.  If you can't attend, and are nominated, we'll let you
know that you were nominated, at which point you can let us know if you accept
or decline.

The week after will be elections for the new board!  Any nominees will either
have to be in attendance, or be willing to provide us with your speech so that
we can make sure your voice is heard, despite your absence.
