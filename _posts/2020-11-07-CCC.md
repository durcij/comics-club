The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0r4xfbdOLOSuWYK_gb5oTCAwnQjt2T5nNTOPs56cdPSaQSQ/viewanalytics) are in!  Narmak's Suponjibobu Anime has won the vote for our final *discussion* of the on-campus portion of the semester!  As this week's *discussion* is a singular YouTube video, there are no worries if you haven't seen it before.

The *discussion* will be gathering around 3:00pm eastern in CC 301/302 and the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The video center on SpongeBob, but in a form you have definitely never seen on Nickelodeon.  YouTube tried to take it down, but it was restored in all of it's Bubble Bass-y glory!  These video is mildly graphic, and it gets a pretty intense, so if you feel uncomfortable with the *discussion* at any time, please don't be afraid to hop out.  Normally, we'd provide an IMDB parental warning page link for more information, but, as this is an independent animator, there is no such link.  That said, expect Naruto/Dragonball levels of violence.

If you're itching to check it out, it's the video below, but we'll also be watching it before the *discussion*:
