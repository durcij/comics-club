If you want to request a book from our collection for this coming reading and drawing meeting on Saturday we now have a public Google Sheet called [Comics Club's Offerings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WQBwB8FLICge_KHPHwAXRH32r5OgDy0FAQjJdK4rhtI/edit?usp=sharing).  The sheet lists every book in our collection at the moment!  If you'd like to request a comic, just comment your name on the title of the comic you'd like, and we'll make sure we bring it with us on Saturday!
