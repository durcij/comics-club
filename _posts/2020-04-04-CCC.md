The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZAXbH2eUNWQvQtCUJAwz8oTbqus8ZwQEMMafYvKJlHtFEzw/viewanalytics) are in!  Cells at Work has won the vote for our *discussion* this week!  We'll be starting our *discussion* from where we left off last week (starting at episode 7), unless there's a consensus to start from the beginning.

The *discussion* will be gathering around 2:00pm eastern in the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The show depicts cells within the body as people, and is remarkably medically accurate in a number of ways, according to Comics Club Treasurer, Will Haden.  The show can be a little violent at times, so if you plan on joining the *discussion*, please don't be afraid to step out if you become uncomfortable.
