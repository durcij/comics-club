It's official, summer break has arrived, and with it, the end of the academic year!  Thank you everyone, whether you were new to Comics this year, or are veterans of the club!  We appreciate all of you for coming out each week to Comics Club, CCC, live reads, and events!

We can't wait to see all of the fresh faces at next year's Involvement Fair, and we're especially looking forward to seeing all of the returning faces, too!

Have a great summer everyone!  We'll see you next year!
