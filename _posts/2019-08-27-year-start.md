The new year has arrived, and with it, so will many new members!  We're excited to see all of the new faces that will be swinging by our general meetings and CCC events!

To start the new year off strong, we've updated the [Upcoming Events](https://comicsclub.netlify.com/events.html) page with a bunch of our newly planned events.  We've also updated the [About](https://comicsclub.netlify.com/about.html) page with our new CCC location for the year!

If you're new to the club and reading this, you've probably stopped by our table at the Involvement Fair, and we're really happy you took the time to check out our website.  We hope to see you at our first CCC this Saturday, and our first meeting next Monday!
