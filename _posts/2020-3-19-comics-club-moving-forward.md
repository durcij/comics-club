In the wake of recent events, namely the cancellation of all on-campus activities, Comics Club will be going digital for the remainder of the semester.  Here are some important changes:

* From now on, we’ll be heavily utilizing the U-Nerd-Ed Nations’ [channel](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) on Discord for ease of communication. If you don’t know already, this is the Discord channel used by the college’s nerd clubs to plan out events and the likes. Here’s the link if you want to join:  https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w

* For those who don’t use Discord, worry not as this website will be updated more frequently with details on current and upcoming events

* We'll be hosting unlisted YouTube streams for CCC's on Saturdays, chat will be on for increased discussion.  Nominations will be done via Google Forms on Saturdays and the results will be announced the following Mondays when votes will go live.  Details on CCC's will also be listed on this website.

* We will be continuing our Green Stripe project for this year.  As of now, the finalized issue will be released as a PDF on this website; that being said, the physical version will be printed at the beginning of the next semester.  If you want your art to be showcased for the Green Stripe, please send your submissions to our VP at his email address:  <[nguyenmail](mailto:nguyenmail@allegheny.edu)>.

* For the sake of convenience, elections for next year’s board will be moved to the beginning of next semester.  T-shirts will also be ordered and distributed around this time.

* The upcoming Bloodshot movie trip is, obviously, cancelled.
