Your Lie in April has won the vote for our final *discussion* of the semester!  We'll be starting our *discussion* from the beginning of the show, so no worries if you haven't seen it before.

Note that, if you want to look at the results, there is one Green Stripe boost vote in this, one for The Pet Girl of Sakurasao (going from 1 to 2 votes).

The *discussion* will be gathering around 2:00pm eastern in the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The show focuses on Kousei Arima, a piano prodigy and his struggles to continue playing the piano after the passing of his mother.  This show is focuses on recovery, romance, and music, but, if you feel uncomfortable with the *discussion* at any time, please don't be afraid to step out.
