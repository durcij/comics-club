We're looking for suggestions in regards to live reads, and, potentially, all of CCC.  We've noticed low turnouts at the Quigley Auditorium events, so please fill out the Google Form we have [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Lik8WxJW1feJGKSF2) so that we can determine what days/locations would work better for all of our members.  This will be starting with the upcoming live read, so get your suggestions in now!

Our next meeting, officer elections day!  This means that we'll be voting for in the new officers next Monday!  If you've been nominated, please attend, or give an officer your speech ahead of time!
