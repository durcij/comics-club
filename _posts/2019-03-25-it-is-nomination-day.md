Today's meeting will be the first meeting after spring break!  That means it's nomination day!  Any members who would like to be officers should make an effort to come to today's meeting.  If you can't attend, and are nominated, we'll let you know that you have been nominated, at which point you can let an officer know if you accept or decline.

Next week's meeting will be election day for the new board!  Any nominees will either have to be in attendance, or be willing to provide an officer with your speech so that we can make sure your voice is heard, despite your absence.  If we aren't provided a speech, and you aren't in attendance, that will be taken as your dropping from the election.
