This week, we had our new broad proceed with their first meeting and introducing Extra Life Event this Saturday.

## Officer Announcements

**Will:**  Congratulations to everyone who attended Extra Life!!!!! And I hope everyone has a good break!!!!

**Linh:**  (Shows up 13 minutes later...) Last comics club meeting trademark (unenthusiastically)

**Chaz:**  (*Laughs*) Don't zone out while driving

**Surinder:** M.I.A, so here is his Discord highlight: "Ayo I can abuse my position as officer for clout/ay follow my twitter/jk.... unless"

**Aditya:**  I think The Matrix, Aliens, and other powerful and certain forces out there are real, unstoppable, pure evil, and after us for no reason. Also STAY OFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA because people are spoiling Miles Morales already.

**feck:**     Bite of the banana, bite of the orange, bite of the womb bat s--t.

## Important Notices

Comics Club Complete is every weekend, alternating between *discussing* things and other events like Live Read and reading and drawing days.

Send us comics for the Green Stripe!  They can be good, they can be bad, they can be silly, they can be sad.  Be it in crayon, marker, pencil, or pen, if it gets sent we'll put it in!  Send them my way at <[nguyenmail](mailto:nguyenmail@allegheny.edu)>.  More info on the Green Stripe will be coming soon, as well!
