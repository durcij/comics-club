The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeClW7Z1MkU2PX1MxhiLNjePxLSwDRcZHDKOUA9B4xKiN22rg/viewanalytics) are in!  The Ghost Rider films have won the vote for our fourth *discussion* of the semester!  As this week's *discussion* is on two films, there are no worries if you haven't seen them before.

The *discussion* will be gathering around 3:00pm eastern in CC 301/302 and the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The movies center on a man named Johnny Blaze who has sold his soul to the Devil to save his father's life.  Now he's the Devil's bounty hunter, and is left to hunt down sinners in two action-packed, cheese-filled adventures!  These films aren't extremely graphic, but they can be intense and scary, so if you feel uncomfortable with the *discussion* at any time, please don't be afraid to hop out.  For more information on the content of these films, click [here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259324/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg) for Ghost Rider and [here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1071875/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg) for Ghost Rider:  Spirit of Vengeance.
