We're looking for suggestions in regards to live reads, and, potentially, all of CCC.  We've noticed low turnouts at the Quigley Auditorium events, so please fill out the Google Form we have [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Lik8WxJW1feJGKSF2) so that we can determine what days/locations would work better for all of our members.  This will be starting with this week's CCC, so get your suggestions in now!

Vote for the next CCC [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2H-Rl8zPJAC74tKcL6du1_8znPTul_JzVQOnssGg73JM1eA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

The final deadline for Greenstripe has passed!  Jordan is hard at work to make sure all of the submissions are included!

Tekko, Pittsburgh's annual anime convention, is coming pretty soon!  Sign-ups are closed now, but we look forward to seeing everyone who's signed up in Pittsburgh this April for Tekko!

We're also hoping to be able to have a big Avengers Endgame trip at the end of the year, sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEsLGnhSADnhPLHrjv-IUlKvRHaYfc3yo1J4vXLZNeVBxwPg/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you'd be interested in attending a free movie trip with us!

There's only a couple more days to sign up for an official Comics Club t-shirt as designed by Linh!  If you'd like one, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsyjQMHGcE-tF-zzCtWA_D7HcMHNv7uTaMTqY3Uwh6uQki8g/viewform?usp=sf_link) now!  You're also able to help pick the shirt color we'll be going for, so definitely get in on that if you haven't already.

## Meeting Summary

In this week's meeting, we did something fun for April Fool's Day:  each of the officers dressed up as a different officer (Mike as Thaddeus, Jordan as Star, Star as Jordan, Thaddeus as Linh, and Linh as Mike).  It was a good time.  We also held officer elections, as you can see above.
