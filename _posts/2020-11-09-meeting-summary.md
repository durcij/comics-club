This week, we had our new board proceed with their first meeting and introducing Extra Life Event this Saturday.

## Officer Announcements

**Will:**  I hope everyone has a good end of the semester!

**Linh:**  I'm getting back into Manga.

**Chaz:**  "Happy to be here"

**Surinder:**  M.I.A

**Aditya:**  I hate waiting

**feck:**   "Whoop-feckscoop-feckpoop/ Poop-feckscoopty" (Lyrics by Kanye West's Lift Yourself)

## Important Notices

Comics Club Complete is every weekend, alternating between *discussing* things and other events like Live Read and reading and drawing days.

T-shirts have been designed!  We'll be getting them, and hopefully masks, to everyone as soon as possible (Which will more than likely be next semester)!

Send us comics for the Green Stripe!  They can be good, they can be bad, they can be silly, they can be sad.  Be it in crayon, marker, pencil, or pen, if it gets sent we'll put it in!  Send them my way at <[nguyenmail](mailto:nguyenmail@allegheny.edu)>.  More info on the Green Stripe will be coming soon, as well!

We now have a digital Green Stripe library!  Check it out [here](https://comicsclub.netlify.app/green-stripes.html)!
