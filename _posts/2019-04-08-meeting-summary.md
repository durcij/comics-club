## Important Notices

We're looking for suggestions in regards to live reads, and, potentially, all of CCC.  We've noticed low turnouts at the Quigley Auditorium events, so please fill out the Google Form we have [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Lik8WxJW1feJGKSF2) so that we can determine what days/locations would work better for all of our members.  This will be starting with this week's CCC, so get your suggestions in now!

The final deadline for Greenstripe has passed!  Jordan is hard at work to make sure all of the submissions are included!

Tekko, Pittsburgh's annual anime convention, is coming this weekend!  Sign-ups are closed now, but we look forward to seeing everyone who's signed up in Pittsburgh this weekend for Tekko!

We're also hoping to be able to have a big Avengers Endgame trip on May 1st, sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEsLGnhSADnhPLHrjv-IUlKvRHaYfc3yo1J4vXLZNeVBxwPg/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you'd be interested in attending a free movie trip with us!  We'll be maxing at 15 free tickets this year, so please sign-up soon.

We're still holding last minute t-shirt sign-ups.  If you'd like one, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsyjQMHGcE-tF-zzCtWA_D7HcMHNv7uTaMTqY3Uwh6uQki8g/viewform?usp=sf_link) now!  You're also able to help pick the shirt color we'll be going for, so definitely get in on that if you haven't already.

## Meeting Summary

This week, we did some art stuff, specifically, we all spent about 25 minutes working on group Greenstripe covers.  We passed our pages clockwise once every minute, leading to some wonky looking covers.  Pretty soon we'll be sending out a poll to vote for which cover looks best.  The winner will be this year's cover.
