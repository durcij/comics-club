This week, we did some of our usual clerical business, nominating things to read and *discuss* for the next two weekends.

## Officer Announcements

**Jordan:**  Look at the very important form.  It's important.

**Linh:**  Something something the form.

**Will:**  I see why I'm the treasurer; I budgeted too hard.  Go look at the form.

**Gabby:**  I'm having a terrible week.

**Gwen:**  Is that time of the year, y'all.  Just get through it.  Survive.

**feck:**  I have no sarcasm to respond with that has "feck" in it, so I'm just gonna say "feck," or just put the words that I'm saying right now because I'm just rambling.
