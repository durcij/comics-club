The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFo3KDiVPQdfv0xGiKjtFyh8gx4ebjrFi-wCnZyjEDvH-nLw/viewanalytics) are in!  Gantz:  0 has won the vote for our *discussion* this week!  We'll be starting our *discussion* from the beginning of the show, so no worries if you haven't seen it before.

Note that, if you want to look at the results, there is one Green Stripe boost vote in this, one for Gantz:  0 (going from 2 to 3 votes).

The *discussion* will be gathering around 2:00pm eastern in the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The movie is a CG rollercoaster ride where many different yokai attack a simulated city. It's action-packed, and full of interesting visuals.  That said, it gets pretty violent at times, and apparently there will be breasts utilized to some interesting? effects, so if you plan on joining the *discussion*, please don't be afraid to step out if you become uncomfortable.
