Our work making this website the best it can be hasn't ended with the spring semester!  Changes have been made based upon feedback to improve the overall readability of the Comics Club website.

Gone are the mustardy, distracting yellows, in favor of softer golds!  Gone is the limited distinction between blog posts, in favor of a new, narration box-inspired design!  Gone is the jumbled nav menu, in favor of a clear, organized menu, with a new shadow to boot!

We hope that these changes will improve your experiences in using our website, and that everyone continues to have a great summer!  We'll see you in the fall!
