The [results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCam3ynyZ8tymDeOVRYqlnhE7hR_3bzsm3czHsDstoFgWVzg/viewanalytics) are in!  Spirited Away has won the vote for our third *discussion* of the semester!  As this week's *discussion* is on a movie, there are no worries if you haven't seen it before.

The *discussion* will be gathering around 3:00pm eastern in CC 301/302 and the [U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w) in the CCC voice channel.

The movie centers on Chihiro, a young girl who gets dragged into a world full of yokai, kami, and other spirits.  It's by Hayao Miyazaki, so you know it's high quality.  This film isn't particularly graphic or intense, but if you feel uncomfortable with the *discussion* at any time, please don't be afraid to hop out.
