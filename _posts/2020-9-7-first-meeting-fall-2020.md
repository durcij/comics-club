Today will be our first meeting of the year!  It will be held through the U-Nerd-Ed Nations Discord server in the General Meetings voice channel under the Remote Comics Stuff header.  To join the Discord, click [here](https://discord.gg/JqfTQ7w).  It's not just Comics Club in there, so feel free to look around and check out the other clubs if you haven't already.

Anyway, we'll be holding nominations for our first CCC's of the year, as well as discussing what we'll be doing going forward with the semester, especially once in-person meetings resume starting next week.
