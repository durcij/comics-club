## First Comics Club General Meeting
**Date:** September 2, 2019  
**Time:** 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM  
**Location:** CC 206  
**Description:** We'll be holding our first general meeting, where we'll have easy access to our 2018-2019 Green Stripe, our club's self-published comic and art magazine.  We'll also be doing a fun art/writing activity that will both help break the ice for all of our new additions, as well as be a fun time for all of our returning members.  Don't worry if you aren't a great artist, most of us aren't either.  

## Creepy Comics Club
**Date:** October 26, 2019  
**Time:** 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM  
**Location:** CC 303  
**Description:** This will be a spooky live read!  The specific comic is still undecided, as we vote for them ahead of time.  We won't know until we get nice and close to this one, but hopefully we'll all pick a good one!  

## Comics Crypt General Meeting
