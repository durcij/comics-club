## Inktober 2020
**Date:** October 1st through 31st, 2020  
**Time:** Daily  
**Location:** Anywhere  
**Description:** We'll be giving out a list of words as prompts once they're settled, but in the end, there will be 31 total prompts, one for each day of October.  All you'll have to do is make some art for each prompt as the days roll by.  Don't worry about keeping up or falling behind, we won't judge.
