**Name:** Jordan Durci  
**Major:** Computer Science  
**Minors:** Psychology and Philosophy  
**Bio:** It me, the mad lad, the human, the Jordan Durci.  I live nearish to Pittsburgh (but I grew up nearish to Erie just outside a town called Waterford), I'm a big fan of the MCU, and watch less anime than I'd like.  I also love video games, and have previously been a treasurer and vice president in the Legion of Allegheny Gamers (LAG).  I play a lot of Nintendo titles, and have a YouTube channel dedicated to a mixture of streams of nuzlockes and playing board games with friends.  
**Duties:** Running meetings, live reads, and charity events, maintaining the safe space, and running votes.  

## Vice President

**Name:** Linh Nguyen Mai  
**Major:** Art and Technology  
**Minor:** Computer Science  
**Bio:** I'm Linh, and I make art.  I have an unhealthy obsession with Speedwagon from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.  I call him Speedwagon because that's all Speedwagon needs.  There's only one Speedwagon.  I wish he was real.  The world's unfair.  I just want my Speedwagon.  
**Duties:** Organizing the annual Green Stripe and filling in for officers that aren't present.
