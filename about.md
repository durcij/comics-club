We're Allegheny College's one and only Comics Club!  We do things that relate to comics, obviously, but we're not limited to comics.  We also discuss anime, cartoons, and all sorts of things!  Our goal is to provide a safe and inclusive space for all fans of these media.  This website will help to keep you up to date on our events, meetings, and changes.

We meet every Monday from 5pm to 6pm in CC 206 for our general meetings, and every Saturday from around 1pm to 5pm in Quigley Auditorium for CCC, when we do longer things like live reads.

To get on the email list, you can email our secretary at <[nguyenmail](mailto:nguyenmail@allegheny.edu)> or our vice president at <[durcij](mailto:durcij@allegheny.edu)>.

If you'd like to suggest an event, or give us some feedback, feel free to email our president at <[eltmanm](mailto:eltmanm@allegheny.edu)> or our vice president at <[durcij](mailto:durcij@allegheny.edu)>.

We also have a [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/359659447419354/) and a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Y8hpXNW) that you should feel free to join!
